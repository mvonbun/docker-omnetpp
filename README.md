## Branch - Docker Image Relation
The master branch gets the `latest` Docker image.

Docker image versions are managed using different branches.  Branches are named
`ubuntu.version-omnet.version` (e.g. `16.04-5.0`).  From each branch, a separate
Docker image with the same tag as the branch name is build.
